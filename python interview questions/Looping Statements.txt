1.
What keyword is used for looping?
    ANS:for
    
2.
What function can generate a list of numbers?
    ANS: range()

3.
Name the 2 keywords used for looping?
    ANS: for and while
    
4.
What module is used for generating random values?
    ANS: random()
    
5.
What keyword is used to skip back to the beginning of a loop?
    ANS: continue
    
6.
What keyword is used to end looping completely?
    ANS: break
    
7.
Use range to generate a list from 1 through 5?
    ANS: range(1,6)
    
8.
Write the code needed to generate a random number between 1 through 50 and assign it to rand_num?
        ANS: random.randrange(1,51)
        
9.
What numbers does the following Range generate: range(5,10)?
    ANS: 5,6,7,8,9
        Explanation: Range starts at 5 and goes up to (but not including) 10
        
10.
What numbers does the following range generate range(3)?
    ANS: 0,1,2
    Explanation: Range will start at 0 and go up to (but not including) 3
    
11.
What is printed out after the following code nums = range(1,5) print(nums)?
    ANS:range(1,5)
    Explanation: Printing range does not print out all the numbers in the range. We have to iterate over the range with a loop to print the numbers.
    
12.
What numbers does the following range generate range(8,0,-2):
    ANS: 8,6,4,2
    Explanation: The 3rd argument(step) indicates that range should work backwards from 8, moving 2 numbers at a time.
    
13.
 What does the following loop do?
 i = 1
while i < 5:
i + i
print(i)
    ANS:It prints 1 forever
    Explanation: Don't forget to add the + before the = sign when incrementing!
    
14.
What does the following loop do?

# print 1 to 5
i = 0
while i <= 5:
i =+ 1
print(i)

    ANS:It prints 1 forever because there is a typo with the increment which should be += instead of =+.
    
15.
What can we do to get out of the infinite loop below?
#this code runs forever...
x = 0
while x != 11:
x += 2
print(x)
    ANS:Change the condition to x ! = 10
        Change the condition to x < 11
        Add logic that says if x == 10: break
        Press control + C while your program is running to kill it
        
16.
 For loops are used to loop over:
     ANS:Iterable objects
     
17.
What is the tradeoff when using while loops for looping?
    ANS: While loops are more flexible since you explicitly set the start and end conditions, but they require more setup than for loops
    
18.
What does the break keyword do?
    ANS:Exits the loop immediately
    Explanation: break is the fastest way to get out of a loop -- it won't run any code after the break
    
19.
What does the following code print?

for x in range(5):
print(x)
    ANS:0 1 2 3 4
        Explanation: Python ranges start at zero by default and count up to, but not including, the end number.
        
20.
Which of the following type of loop(s) is/are not supported by Python?
    ANS: do while
