1.
What is pass in Python?
    ANS:Pass means, no-operation Python statement, or in other words it is a place holder in compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there.
    
2.
What Does The Continue Do In Python? 
    ANS:The continue is a jump statement in Python which moves the control to execute the next iteration in a loop leaving all the remaining instructions in the block unexecuted. The continue statement is applicable for both the “while” and “for” loops.
    
3.
When Should You Use The “Break” In Python?
    ANS:Python provides a break statement to exit from a loop. Whenever the break hits in the code, the control of the program immediately exits from the body of the loop. The break statement in a nested loop causes the control to exit from the inner iterative block.
    
4.
What Is The Difference Between Pass And Continue In Python? 
    ANS:The continue statement makes the loop to resume from the next iteration.
         On the contrary, the pass statement instructs to do nothing, and the remainder of the code executes as usual.
         
5.
What constitutes “True” in Python?
    ANS:A true expression is any expression that does not evaluate to 0, the empty list [ ], tuple ( ), dictionary { } or the objects None or False.
    
6.
What are the three main conditional statements in Python?
    ANS:if, elif, and else
    
7.
What are the comparison operators in Python?
    ANS:< Less than, > Greater than, <= Less than or equal to, >= Greater than or equal to, = Equal to, != not equal, o alternative not equal. Note a single = is NOT a Python comparison operator, it is an assignment operator only.
    
8.
Illustrate a basic if, elif, else structure.
    ANS:if <condition>:
            . . .
        elif<another condition>:
            . . .
        else:
            . . .
            
9.
In Python 2.5+, the equivalent of a tertiary operator has been added to the language. Provide an example of its use.
    ANS:myValue = ‘Positive’ if myNumber > 0 else ‘Negative or Zero’
    
10.
What does elif mean?
    ANS:It means else if. It is used after an if statement, to do another comparison.
    
11.
What would the output be from the following code? a =4 If a = 5:
Print “True”
Else:
Print “False”
    ANS:This is a trick question. The a = 5 is not a comparison operator, but an assignment. It will yield “True”. The correct coding would be a == 5.
    
12.
How are if, elif, and else blocks defined?
    ANS:All blocks in Python are defined by indenting. All lines of a particular code block must have the same level of indenting.
    
13.
Illustrate a switch-case equivalent using if-elif-else.
    ANS:if item=valueA:
            . . .
        elif item == valueB:
            . . .
        elif item = =  valueC:
            . . .
        elifitem = valueN:
            . . .
        else:
            … #default code
            
14.
How is the Python switch statement used?
    ANS:This is a trick question, there is no built-in switch statement in Python, which is unusual. A switch statement can be easily created using if-elif using lambda or with Python dictionaries.
    
15.
Using a dictionary, create an equivalent to a switch case statement.
            ANS: deffunc1( ):
                . . .
                deffunc2( ):
                . . .
                switch = {
                ‘Aardvark’: fund1,
                ‘Armadillo’: fund2,
                 }
                mySwi tchKey= “Armadillo ”
                switch[mySwitchKey]( ) #callsJunc2( )
                switch[‘Aardvark’]( ) #calls func1( )
                
16.
Illustrate comparing two strings for equality in a case insensitive manner.
    ANS:if stringl. lower ( ) = string2.lower ( ):
#Note: .upper( ) is equally valid.

17.
Illustrate comparing two strings, printing if the first string is longer, equal, or shorter than the second string.
    ANS:if len(stringl) > len(string2):
            print “Stringl is longer than string2.”
        elif len(stringl) < len(string2):
            print “String1 is shorter than string2.”
        else:
            print “String1 is the same length as string2.”
            
18.
When comparing two d^tes, what method is used?
    ANS: Date.toordinal( ) Otherwise, Python would compare the dates by their object address.
    
19.
In comparing dates and DateTime objects, what happens when one comparand is naive and the other aware?
    ANS:A TypeError is raised.
    
20.
What happens when you try to compare a DateTime object with other classes of objects?
    ANS:A TypeError is raised.
    
21.
When are dictionaries considered equal?
    ANS:If and only if their sorted lists compare equally.
    
22.
How is collection membership determined?
    ANS: Using the in and not in operators.
    
23.
Illustrate how collection membership determination would be written.
    ANS:if x in collection:
            print “It is in the collection”
        else:
            print “Not in the collection.”
            
24.
How is object identity tested? Illustrate with an example.
    ANS:Using the is and is not operators.
        if x is objecttype:
            print “x is the type you thought it was.
        else:
            print “x isn’t an objecttype.”
